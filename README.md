  ## Description
  READMEs are an important aspect of a developer's work as it takes the opportunity to describe and showcase what the project they were working on is really about. A good ReadMe can describe what the project is, where to access it, who worked on it, and etc. There is no one definite way on how to write a ReadMe, but there are definitely ones that can separate the good from the bad. This ReadMe generator will allow users to create fresh readMes without the stress of creating ones from scratch.

  ## Installation
  This ReadMe generator can be accessed from my current Github repo, which a link will be included below. A user can either clone the repo from a SSH or HTTP key. User will also need to download Node Package Manager in a terminal using “npm init -y” and download the inquirer package using “npm i inquirer@8.2.4.

  ## Usage
  Once a repo is cloned and packages are installed, the user can access the terminal and initiate “ node index.js” in index.js and this will initiate the question prompts. Users will fill out according to their needs and project basis and will have completed a readMe.
